This Generic Exploratory Data Analysis (GEDA) is a framework to simplify the beginners' task of cleaning and data analysis for any Machine Learning Algorithm. In this code, the dataset needs to be uploaded, then it can clean the unnecessary data (i.e. Null, Outliers, Duplicates, etc.) and analyze it's common properties and visualize all possible graphs in that dataset. Then it finally exports the processed dataset file (.csv/.xlsx) for its further use in any Machine learning or Data Science Projects.
